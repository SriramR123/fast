## Introduction

The Vedic Multiplier is a multiplication algorithm inspired by ancient Indian mathematics. This repository focuses on a 4-bit implementation, utilizing fast adders with only 10 transistors per adder. The design is carried out using S-Edit on Tanner EDA, a powerful tool for IC layout and schematic capture.

## Design Details

The primary components of this repository include:

- **4-Bit Vedic Multiplier**: The main module for multiplying two 4-bit numbers using Vedic multiplication techniques.

- **10-Transistor Fast Adders**: Unlike traditional full adders with 28 transistors, this design employs fast adders with only 10 transistors. The reduced transistor count contributes to improved efficiency and performance.

## Prerequisites

Before using or contributing to this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Tanner EDA installed on your system
- Basic understanding of digital circuit design
- Familiarity with S-Edit for IC layout

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SriramR123/fast.git
```

## Usage

1. Open the project in Tanner EDA's S-Edit.
2. Navigate to the design files for the 4-bit Vedic Multiplier and the 10-Transistor Fast Adders.
3. Examine the layout, schematics, and other relevant design files.
4. Simulate the design to verify its functionality.
